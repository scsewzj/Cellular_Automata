## Abstract: 

Mathematical Oncology has emerged as a research field that applies either continuous or discrete models to mathematically describe cancer-related phenomena[1]. Such methods are usually expressed in terms of differential equations, however tumor composition involves specific cellular structure and can demonstrate probabilistic nature, often requiring tailor-made approaches[2]. It may suggest to decouple biomolecular micro level and cell growing macro level which simplify the tumor growth dynamics simulation with only probablistic parameters[3]. With proper parameters, not only the fidelity can be preserved, but also heterogenesis can be extended. Tumor cells vary in dynamics due to different pluripotency or mutated genes[4]. We try to modelize the heterogeous dynamics within the tumors via mathematical oncology in form of cellular automata.
